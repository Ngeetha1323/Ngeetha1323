# client-server-connection

This project shows how a simple client_server connection works using python sockets

# How to run

1.Python 3 Keepalive is installed by default in newer releases of python 3 so you will not need to install any additional modules.

2.Navigate to the folder your server. py and client. py files are saved.

3.Open up two terminals or two command prompts.

4.It's really so simple; from one terminal, start the server with: python server. py

5.In the second terminal, start the client –python client. py

6.You can observe that the client is sending a message and server is responding, thus connection is resorting.

# Understand about the project

1.This project shows an example of how two Python programs can communicate over the Internet.

2.The server's waiting for a connection and responding to messages the clients send.

3.A connection between the client and the server is established and the client sends the first message.

4.It helps to learn basics of real time data or chat transfer in networks.

5.The project is good to get insight into real-world server-client communication for systems like messaging app, file transfer, etc
